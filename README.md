Employee Management System (CLI)
================================

Introduction
------------

The **Employee Management System (EMS)** is a command line interface (CLI) tool built using Python, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite to manage employees, departments, and roles in an organization. This application allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing these entities directly from the command line.

With EMS, users can:

*   Add, update, delete, and view departments.
    
*   Add, update, delete, and view roles.
    
*   Add, update, delete, and view employees, with department and role assignments.
    

This project is designed for simplicity and is strictly a terminal-based application without a web interface, making it ideal for small-scale or local employee management tasks.

Features
--------

*   **Manage Departments**: Add, update, delete, and view departments in the organization.
    
*   **Manage Roles**: Add, update, delete, and view roles available in the organization.
    
*   **Manage Employees**: Add, update, delete, and view employee details, including their assigned department, role, and salary.
    
*   **Relational Database**: Departments and roles are linked to employees via foreign keys, ensuring that employees are correctly assigned within the system.
    

Technologies Used
-----------------

*   **Python 3.x**
    
*   **SQLAlchemy**: ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for managing the database and models.
    
*   **SQLite**: Embedded database for storing departments, roles, and employees.
    
*   **Click**: Python library for building command-line interfaces.
    
*   **Tabulate** (optional): For neatly formatting the output in tables.
    

Prerequisites
-------------

Before setting up the application, make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.x**
    
*   **Virtual environment** 
    

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Follow these steps to set up the Employee Management System (EMS) on your local machine.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

`   https://github.com/itsivali/employee-management-cli.git  cd employee-management-cli   `

### 2\. Set Up a Virtual Environment 

`   python3 -m venv venv  source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/Mac  venv\Scripts\activate        # On Windows   `

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages by running:

`   pip install -r requirements.txt   `

If you donâ€™t have a requirements.txt file yet, you can manually install the dependencies using:

`   pip install sqlalchemy click tabulate   `

### 4\. Set Up the Database

The database is automatically set up the first time you run the application. It will create a SQLite database (employee\_management.db) in the current directory.

### 5\. Running the Application

To launch the EMS application, run the following command:

`   python cli.py main-menu   `

You will be given the main menu to choose which entity to manage (departments, roles, or employees).
